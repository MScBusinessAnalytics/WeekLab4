    "## What is API?\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. Most APIs, require authorization before the service provider will give you an assess token that allowing you to call the API and pull the data. We will explore this in our next level of the exercise for fetching data from Twitter. In this basic level of the exercise, we will use a python library that integrating the authorization process which is very friendly to the beginners. \n",

    "## About yfinance\n",
    "\n",
    "Please visit the documentation of yfinance via this [link](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and you should read the legal disclaimer before using the library. yfinance is a Python library that gives public an easy access to financial data available on [Yahoo Finance](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/). One of the big advantages of this library is that it returns the data as Pandas DataFrames, which we introduced in the last week tutorial. In most of the cases we deal with APIs to pull the data, transforming data to an organised format is the one of the most difficult parts. The library of yfinance has helped us to organise it properly which is a plus for the beginner.\n",

    "## The learning outcomes of this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the public available library in Python;\n",
    "2. Understanding the use of documentation of library to solve problem;\n",
    "3. Collecting data and organise them properly in Python DataFrame;\n",
    "4. Using the descriptive techniques to analyse the company's profiles.\n",
